# Project: Your first neural network
## My 1st Project in the Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree Program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Link to the Udacity project repository

https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/first-neural-network

### Project Overview
In this project, I built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Run

In order to run the code in the jupyter notebook you also need the file [**day.csv**](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/first-neural-network/Bike-Sharing-Dataset/day.csv) and [**hour.csv**](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/first-neural-network/Bike-Sharing-Dataset/hour.csv) from the [Udacity project repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/first-neural-network).

Load the file with jupyter notebook using the following command:

```jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb```
